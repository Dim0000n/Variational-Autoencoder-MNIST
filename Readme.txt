Hi!
You can find some variational autoencoders for handwrite digits generation here. This model were trained  with MNIST-dataset.
There is a variational aoutoencoder in file VAE, and there is conditional variatioval autoencoder in file CVAE_for_MNIST.
Second consist of two models with different complexity. These models can create define digits with label. 

Best wishes!
